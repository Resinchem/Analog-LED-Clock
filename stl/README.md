## 3D Printed Parts Design (.stl) Files

These are the .stl files for all the 3D printed parts I used for the clock project.  All parts were printed using PLA on a Creality Ender 3 Pro.  Supports were not needed, although you may wish to add them for the clock stand.

**Important Note**: The clock face has a diameter of 215 mm.  Be sure this will fit on your build plate.  For me, it was necessary to disable the skirt for the print to fit.

|File | Part Description
-----|-----
|Clock Face.stl | The front clock face
|Clock Stand.stl | The desk stand to hold the clock in a slightly canted postion
|ILI9341 Display Trim.stl | A small trim piece to super glue to the clock face around the display opening
|Number Covers.stl | Small blocks to glue over the back clock face number cutouts to block light bleedover
|Standoff Mounts.stl | Mounts to super glue to the back of clock face for mounting the threaded ends of M3 brass stand-offs.
