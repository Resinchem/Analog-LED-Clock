## Analog-LED-Clock
This project started as a way to demonstrate the use of MCP23017 port expanders with ESP boards.  I decided to take the original breadboard version and use it to create my first custom PCB. I also added some additional features to the final clock.

This particular project was primarily about the journey of designing and using a custom PCB.  If you want to know more about this particular project, please refer to the following:

If you want to know more about the MCP23017 port expanders, I cover those in the following:

### The clock controller code, PCB design files and the 3D .stl files are shared here "AS-IS"!

The files are being shared here primarily as support for the above video and blog article and for those that wish to learn more about how it works, or to use my version as a framewwork for their own project.  And while I will provide some general information in each folder's README file and a little more in the wiki, it is unlikely I will continue to make enhancements.  And while the PCB was designed to also accommodate an ESP32 mini instead of the D1 Mini/ESP8266, I do not intend to release an ESP32 version.  **PLEASE DON'T ASK!**<br><br />
If you wish to use an ESP32, clone or fork the repository and update the libraries and GPIO pins for the ESP32 mini.  I will not be accepting PRs, issue reports or enhancement requests for this repo.  If you have questions or comments, please post those in the comment section of the above video or blog article.
